# Task ID: 6
# Title: Loop Creation and Management Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core functionality for creating, updating, and managing email loops based on the rule engine results.
# Details:
Develop logic to create new loops when matching emails are found. Implement functions to add emails to existing loops. Create algorithms to determine loop status based on component emails. Build loop timeline generation logic. Implement manual loop creation functionality. Develop APIs for loop management (archiving, deletion, etc.). Create utility functions for loop querying and filtering.

# Test Strategy:
Test automatic loop creation with sample emails. Verify that emails are correctly added to existing loops. Validate that loop status is accurately determined. Test manual loop creation and management. Ensure loop timeline generation correctly orders emails.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Loop Creation and Email Association Core [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the fundamental data structures and functions for creating new loops and associating emails with existing loops based on rule engine results.
### Details:
Create the core Loop model with essential properties (id, status, created_at, updated_at, title, etc.). Implement functions to create new loops when rule engine identifies matching emails. Build logic to associate new emails with existing loops based on rule criteria. Create the primary database interactions for loop persistence. Implement basic validation to ensure data integrity during loop creation and email association.

## 2. Loop Status Management and Timeline Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to determine and update loop status based on component emails, and implement timeline generation logic.
### Details:
Create status calculation algorithms that analyze email metadata, content, and rule matches to determine loop state (open, pending, resolved, etc.). Implement automatic status transitions based on new email additions or time-based triggers. Build timeline generation functionality that creates a chronological view of loop activity including email additions, status changes, and user actions. Ensure timeline events are generated and stored with appropriate metadata for filtering and display.

## 3. Manual Loop Operations and Utility Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement manual loop creation, modification capabilities, and develop utility functions for loop querying and filtering.
### Details:
Build interfaces for manual loop creation that allow users to create loops independent of rule engine. Implement functions to manually add/remove emails from loops. Create utility functions for querying loops based on various criteria (status, date ranges, contained emails, etc.). Develop filtering capabilities to support different views of loops. Implement search functionality across loop properties and contained emails. Create pagination and sorting utilities for loop collections.

## 4. Loop Management APIs and Administrative Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Create comprehensive APIs for loop management including archiving, deletion, and other administrative operations.
### Details:
Design and implement RESTful API endpoints for all loop operations (create, read, update, delete). Build archiving functionality that preserves loops for historical reference while removing them from active views. Implement soft-deletion and restoration capabilities. Create bulk operation functions for managing multiple loops simultaneously. Develop administrative tools for loop auditing and maintenance. Implement access control to ensure proper authorization for loop management operations. Create event logging for all loop modifications to support audit trails.
