# Task ID: 9
# Title: Missing Step Detection and Notifications
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the system for detecting missing or delayed steps in loops and create notifications for users.
# Details:
Develop algorithms to compare actual loop progression against expected templates. Implement detection of missing or delayed steps. Create notification generation logic. Build notification storage and retrieval system. Implement notification UI components. Develop user preference settings for notification types. Create notification clearing and management functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test missing step detection with incomplete loop samples. Verify that notifications are generated for appropriate scenarios. Validate that user preferences correctly filter notifications. Ensure notifications are properly displayed in the UI and can be managed by users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Missing Step Detection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms to compare actual loop progression against expected templates and identify missing or delayed steps
### Details:
Create a detection service that: 1) Loads expected step templates for each loop type, 2) Implements comparison logic to match actual loop progression against templates, 3) Calculates time thresholds for steps based on historical data, 4) Defines detection criteria for both missing steps and delayed steps, 5) Returns standardized detection results with step details, severity, and timestamps. The algorithm should handle different loop types and account for variable timing patterns.

## 2. Build Notification Generation and Storage System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a system to generate notifications from detection results and store them for retrieval
### Details:
Implement a notification service that: 1) Consumes detection results from the detection algorithm, 2) Transforms results into structured notification objects with appropriate metadata (type, severity, timestamp, affected loop/step), 3) Creates a database schema for notification storage with indexes for efficient retrieval, 4) Implements CRUD operations for notifications, 5) Adds batch processing capabilities for handling multiple notifications, 6) Includes a notification lifecycle management system (new, seen, addressed, archived).

## 3. Develop User Notification Preferences and Delivery [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create user preference settings for notification types and implement the delivery mechanism
### Details:
Build a user preference system that: 1) Allows users to configure which notification types they receive (missing steps, delays, specific loops), 2) Implements severity thresholds customization, 3) Supports delivery method preferences (in-app, email, push), 4) Creates notification frequency controls to prevent alert fatigue, 5) Develops a delivery engine that respects user preferences when sending notifications, 6) Implements queuing and retry logic for failed notification deliveries.

## 4. Implement Notification UI and Management Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Build the user interface components for displaying and managing notifications
### Details:
Create UI components that: 1) Display notifications in a dedicated notification center with filtering and sorting options, 2) Show real-time notification indicators in the application header, 3) Implement notification detail views with contextual actions (mark as read, dismiss, address), 4) Build a notification preferences management interface, 5) Create notification grouping for related issues, 6) Add bulk actions for managing multiple notifications, 7) Implement notification history views for auditing purposes.
