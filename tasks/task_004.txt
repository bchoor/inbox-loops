# Task ID: 4
# Title: Gmail API Integration for Email Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with Gmail API to fetch emails, extract metadata, and implement the foundation for email monitoring.
# Details:
Implement Gmail API client using the appropriate SDK. Create functions to fetch emails with pagination support. Develop metadata extraction for email headers, subject, sender, and content. Implement efficient caching mechanisms to minimize API calls. Create a background process for monitoring new emails. Build utility functions for searching emails by various criteria. Ensure proper error handling for API rate limits and failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test email fetching with different pagination parameters. Verify metadata extraction works correctly for various email formats. Validate that the caching mechanism reduces API calls. Test error handling for common API issues. Ensure the monitoring process correctly identifies new emails.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Gmail API client with OAuth authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the initial Gmail API client setup with proper OAuth2 authentication flow
### Details:
Create a service class that handles OAuth2 authentication with Gmail API. Implement functions to generate auth URL, handle redirect, store and refresh tokens. Use the appropriate SDK (Google API Client Library) for your language. Set up proper credential management and secure storage for tokens. Include configuration for required API scopes (gmail.read, gmail.modify, etc.). Create a simple test to verify successful authentication and connection.

## 2. Implement email fetching with pagination [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop functions to retrieve emails from Gmail with proper pagination support
### Details:
Build on the authenticated client to create methods for fetching emails. Implement query parameters for filtering emails (by date, label, etc.). Support pagination using Gmail's nextPageToken mechanism. Create a method to fetch a specific email by ID. Implement message format conversion from Gmail's raw format to a more usable structure. Add logging for API calls to track usage. Create unit tests with mock responses to verify functionality.

## 3. Develop email metadata extraction [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create utilities to parse and extract relevant metadata from fetched emails
### Details:
Build parser functions to extract key metadata from email objects: sender information (name, email), recipients (to, cc, bcc), subject line, date/time, importance flags, labels/categories, attachment information. Create a standardized metadata object structure that's consistent regardless of email format variations. Implement content extraction for both plain text and HTML email bodies. Add sanitization for potentially malicious content. Create helper methods to decode base64 and quoted-printable encodings used in email parts.

## 4. Implement caching and rate limit handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create a caching layer and mechanisms to handle API rate limits
### Details:
Implement an efficient caching system for email data to minimize API calls. Use appropriate cache invalidation strategies based on email timestamps. Add exponential backoff retry logic for handling rate limit errors (429 responses). Implement request throttling to stay under Gmail API quotas. Create a mechanism to batch requests where appropriate. Add monitoring for API usage metrics. Implement cache persistence to maintain data between application restarts. Add logic to detect and handle API service disruptions.

## 5. Build background monitoring for new emails [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Create a background process to monitor and notify about new emails
### Details:
Implement a background worker that periodically checks for new emails. Create a notification system to alert when new emails arrive matching specific criteria. Implement Gmail push notifications using webhooks if real-time updates are required. Add configurable polling intervals for the background process. Create an event system that other parts of the application can subscribe to for email events. Implement proper error handling with logging for background process failures. Add health checks and self-healing mechanisms for the monitoring system. Create admin controls to pause/resume monitoring.
