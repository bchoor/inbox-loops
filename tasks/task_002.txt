# Task ID: 2
# Title: Supabase Integration and Database Schema Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase project, implement the database schema as defined in the PRD, and create the necessary tables and relationships.
# Details:
Create a new Supabase project. Implement the database schema including User, Loop, LoopEmail, Category, Template, Rule, RuleCategory, and Notification tables as defined in the ERD. Set up foreign key relationships between tables. Create appropriate indexes for performance. Configure row-level security policies for data protection. Implement TypeScript interfaces that match the database schema. Create utility functions for database operations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all tables are created with the correct columns and relationships. Test CRUD operations for each table. Validate that foreign key constraints work as expected. Ensure row-level security policies correctly restrict access to data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Supabase project and configure basic settings [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Supabase project, set up the initial configuration, and establish the connection to the application
### Details:
Create a new Supabase project through the Supabase dashboard. Configure project settings including region selection for optimal performance. Generate and securely store API keys. Set up the Supabase client in the application by installing the required packages (@supabase/supabase-js) and creating a client initialization file with proper environment variables for both development and production environments.

## 2. Implement core database tables and relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the primary database tables (User, Loop, Category, Template) with their relationships and basic constraints
### Details:
Using Supabase SQL editor or migration scripts, create the core tables: User (with authentication fields), Loop (with title, description, status fields), Category (with name, description fields), and Template (with title, content fields). Establish foreign key relationships between these tables (e.g., Loop belongs to User, etc.). Add appropriate NOT NULL constraints and default values. Create indexes on frequently queried columns. Document the schema implementation with comments.

## 3. Implement secondary tables and complete relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create the remaining tables (LoopEmail, Rule, RuleCategory, Notification) and establish all relationships
### Details:
Create the secondary tables: LoopEmail (with email, subject fields linked to Loop), Rule (with condition, action fields), RuleCategory (junction table for Rule and Category), and Notification (with message, status fields linked to User). Set up all remaining foreign key relationships to complete the database schema. Ensure referential integrity with appropriate ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions. Add any composite keys or unique constraints as needed.

## 4. Configure row-level security policies and access controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement RLS policies to secure the database and ensure proper data isolation between users
### Details:
Enable row-level security for all tables. Create RLS policies to ensure users can only access their own data. Implement policies for each table with appropriate READ, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE rules. Create service roles with specific permissions for backend operations. Test security policies thoroughly with different user scenarios. Document all security policies and their intended access patterns.

## 5. Create TypeScript interfaces and database utility functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Develop TypeScript interfaces matching the database schema and utility functions for common database operations
### Details:
Create TypeScript interfaces for all database tables that exactly match the schema. Include proper types for all fields and relationships. Implement type guards where necessary. Develop utility functions for common database operations such as createUser, getLoopsByUser, updateLoop, etc. Create higher-level functions that combine multiple database operations for complex workflows. Implement error handling and input validation in all database functions. Document the API for all utility functions.
