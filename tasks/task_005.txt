# Task ID: 5
# Title: Rule Engine Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core rule engine that will power the loop detection and classification system, including pattern matching and rule evaluation logic.
# Details:
Design and implement the rule evaluation engine. Create pattern matching functions for subject lines, senders, and content. Develop rule action execution logic. Implement priority-based rule processing. Build rule categorization system. Create database functions and APIs for rule management. Implement basic shopping category rules as defined in the PRD. Develop a testing framework for rules to validate their effectiveness.

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases with sample emails to verify pattern matching accuracy. Test rule priority handling to ensure higher priority rules take precedence. Validate that rule actions are correctly executed. Ensure the categorization system properly assigns rules to categories.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Rule Engine Core Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for the rule engine including data models, interfaces, and core components
### Details:
Define the rule data model with attributes for conditions, actions, priority, and categories. Design interfaces for rule evaluation, pattern matching, and action execution. Create a high-level architecture diagram showing component relationships. Implement base classes and interfaces for the rule engine. Define extension points for future rule types. Document the architecture and design decisions.

## 2. Implement Pattern Matching Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop pattern matching algorithms for different email components (subject, sender, content)
### Details:
Create pattern matching functions for exact matches, substring matches, regular expressions, and wildcard patterns. Implement specialized matchers for email addresses and domains. Build content analysis functions that can identify keywords and phrases in email body text. Develop normalization utilities to standardize inputs before matching. Include support for case-insensitive matching and special character handling. Write comprehensive unit tests for each matcher type.

## 3. Build Rule Evaluation and Execution Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Develop the core evaluation engine that processes rules and executes associated actions
### Details:
Implement the rule evaluation pipeline that takes an email and evaluates it against applicable rules. Create the priority-based rule processing system that determines execution order. Develop the action execution framework that performs operations based on matched rules. Build support for compound conditions (AND/OR logic). Implement short-circuit evaluation for performance optimization. Create logging mechanisms to track rule evaluation for debugging. Add metrics collection for rule performance analysis.

## 4. Develop Rule Management Database Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create database schema and API functions for storing, retrieving, and managing rules
### Details:
Design the database schema for rules storage with appropriate indexes. Implement CRUD operations for rules management. Create functions for rule versioning and history tracking. Develop APIs for rule querying with filtering by category, priority, and status. Build batch operations for rule import/export. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed rules. Add database migration scripts. Create data access layer that abstracts database operations from the rule engine.

## 5. Create Rule Testing Framework and Initial Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Build a testing framework for rules and implement the initial set of shopping category rules
### Details:
Develop a rule testing framework that can validate rules against sample emails. Create test data generators for different email types. Implement rule effectiveness metrics and reporting. Build a visual rule tester for manual verification. Implement the basic shopping category rules as defined in the PRD. Create documentation for rule creation best practices. Develop integration tests that verify the complete rule pipeline. Build performance testing tools to ensure rule evaluation meets latency requirements.
