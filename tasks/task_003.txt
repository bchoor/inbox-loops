# Task ID: 3
# Title: Authentication System with Google OAuth
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication using Google OAuth via Supabase, including sign-in, sign-out, and user profile management.
# Details:
Configure Google OAuth provider in Supabase. Implement sign-in and sign-out functionality using Supabase Auth. Create authentication context and hooks for React. Develop user profile setup and management screens. Store and manage Gmail API tokens securely. Implement protected routes that require authentication. Create a user onboarding flow as described in 'Journey 1: New User Onboarding'.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete authentication flow including sign-in, sign-out, and token refresh. Verify that protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Ensure user profile data is correctly stored and retrieved. Validate that Gmail API tokens are securely stored and properly refreshed when expired.
