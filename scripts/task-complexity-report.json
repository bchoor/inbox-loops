      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Project Setup with NextJS, Tailwind, and Shadcn/ui",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List and describe the essential subtasks needed to set up a new NextJS project with TypeScript, configure Tailwind CSS, integrate Shadcn/ui, and establish a scalable folder structure with initial layouts and routing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves established patterns and tools but requires attention to best practices for project structure, TypeScript setup, and UI library integration. It is moderately complex due to the need to configure multiple tools and ensure a maintainable foundation, as discussed in industry guides on scalable Next.js project structures[3][4][5]."

    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Supabase Integration and Database Schema Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the steps needed to create a new Supabase project, define and implement a relational database schema (with foreign keys, indexes, and RLS), generate corresponding TypeScript types, and set up database utility functions.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires knowledge of relational database design, security practices, and TypeScript integration. Implementing a complex schema with relationships, indexes, and row-level security, then synchronizing types/interfaces and utilities, introduces significant complexity and demands careful attention to detail."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Authentication System with Google OAuth",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the main subtasks for configuring Google OAuth with Supabase, implementing sign-in/sign-out, creating authentication contexts/hooks for React, building onboarding flows, and securely managing OAuth tokens.",
      "reasoning": "Secure authentication with third-party providers, context management in React, token handling, and onboarding flows are multifaceted and security-sensitive. Each step must be robust and user-friendly, increasing the complexity substantially."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Gmail API Integration for Email Access",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Identify the key steps for integrating Gmail API using an SDK, fetching and caching emails with pagination, extracting metadata, building background monitoring, and implementing error handling for API rate limits.",
      "reasoning": "Gmail API integration involves dealing with OAuth, data fetching, pagination, error resilience, and asynchronous processing. Handling API limits and reliability adds to the challenge, warranting a high complexity score."

    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Rule Engine Foundation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the core subtasks for designing and implementing a rule engine: pattern matching logic, rule evaluation and priority, action execution, management APIs, and a robust testing framework.",
      "reasoning": "Rule engine design is inherently complex, involving custom logic for pattern recognition, evaluation, extensibility, and testability. It must be performant and maintainable, with well-defined APIs and clear categorization."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Loop Creation and Management Logic",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Describe the main subtasks for implementing email loop creation, updating, status determination, timeline generation, manual loop management, and related API endpoints.",
      "reasoning": "Managing stateful entities based on dynamic rule engine output, designing update and archival flows, and ensuring data consistency make this a moderately high complexity task."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Dashboard and Loop Visualization UI",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the subtasks for building a dashboard UI: implementing layouts, loop cards, detail and timeline views, filtering, responsive design, and search functionality.",
      "reasoning": "UI tasks are generally less complex than backend or integration tasks but require careful design for state management, responsiveness, and accessibility. Connecting to backend data adds moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Category-Specific Templates and Visualization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the critical subtasks for creating category-specific templates, rule sets, specialized visualizations, template management UIs, and logic to apply templates to loops.",
      "reasoning": "Developing specialized templates and visualizations per category introduces a layer of abstraction and additional UI/logic, increasing complexity above generic UI tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Missing Step Detection and Notifications",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the subtasks needed to implement step detection algorithms, notification generation and storage, notification UI components, and user preference management.",
      "reasoning": "Building accurate detection logic, a notification system with delivery and management, and customizable user preferences involves algorithmic complexity and careful UX considerations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Final Testing",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the steps for performance profiling, client/server caching strategies, query and UI optimizations, creating comprehensive automated test suites, deploying to production, and setting up error monitoring.",
      "reasoning": "Performance optimization and testing require full-application understanding, systematic profiling, and best practices for deployment. The breadth of coverage and depth of required verification make this a complex, cross-cutting task."
